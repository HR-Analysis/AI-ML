Data Import
   - Uploaded a CSV file using Colab's file upload feature.
   - Loaded the dataset using `pandas`.

Data Exploration
   - Displayed the first few rows for a quick preview.
   - Checked for missing values.
   - Calculated the percentage of missing data per column.
   - Identified data types for each column.

Formatted Output
   - Presented missing value counts, percentages, and data types in a clean summary table for better readability.

This is a foundational step in preparing data for further analysis, visualization, or machine learning.

Task 2
This Colab script performs basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
 Uploads a CSV file
 Shows mean, median, mode in a summary table
 Plots histograms, boxplots, pairplots, and a correlation heatmap
 Helps identify patterns, trends, and outliers in numeric data
Libraries used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
